;; <h1>Lyceum Test Framework</h1>
;;
;; This namespace contains function designed to put lyceum rules under test.
;;
;; It contains [utility functions](#utility-functions) to simulate riemann
;; operations as fast as your CPU can handle it without spinning up a core.
;;
;; You are probably looking for [`with-rules`](#with-rules), which is the
;; helper macro used when writing test-cases.
;;
;; It is typically used like the following.

;; <pre>
;; (ns my-awesome.namespace-test

;; (deftest my-awesome-test
;;   (with-rules 'my-awesome.namespace

;;     (check-externals
